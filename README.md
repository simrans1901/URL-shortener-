# URL-Shortener
A URL Shortener With Node.js, Express, and MongoDB inspired by Web Dev Simplified.

## Introduction:
In this project, we create a simple URL shortener using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. We use the shortid module to generate unique identifiers for each URL and store them in a MongoDB database. We also keep track of the number of clicks for each shortened URL and display them in a table. We use EJS to render the HTML view and Bootstrap to style the user interface. We also implement a delete function to remove unwanted URLs from the database. Our URL shortener is a simple but functional web application that demonstrates the basic concepts of web development using Node.js and MongoDB.

## Features of Our Application
Some features are as follows:
* URL shortening: The application allows users to enter long URLs and generate short, easy-to-remember URLs.
* URL redirection: The short URLs generated by the application can be used to redirect users to the original long URLs.
* Click tracking: The application tracks the number of clicks on each short URL and displays it to the user.
* URL deletion: The application allows users to delete short URLs that are no longer needed.
* Database storage: The application uses MongoDB to store the full URLs, short URLs, and click counts of each URL.
